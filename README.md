# Advanced Linear On US House Price Dataset
This is a data science project made for the purpose of making predictions on De Cock's house price dataset. The project includes preprocessing steps such as data cleaning and feature selection as well as EDA (exploratory data analysis) and the modelling phase.

Data description and the respective datasets (test and training) can be found in the ```/input``` folder. The output is given in ```.csv``` format in the ```/output``` folder.
Since this is a student project made for educational purposes, to give place to additional documentation and guidance and to simplify the usage, the format of the script is ```.ipynb``` instead of a normal Python script.
